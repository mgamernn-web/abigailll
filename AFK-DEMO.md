## 5. 📢 AFK Mention — DM to AFK user

Sent via DM to the AFK user, telling them who pinged them and where.

```

Posted in the channel where the command was used.

```
🔨 AFK Broken!
👤 Dracula's AFK was broken!

Snow broke Dracula's AFK!
📝 sleeping 💤 • ⏱️ 2 hours 15 mins
```

A DM is also sent to the target user:

```
🔨 Your AFK Was Broken!

Snow broke your AFK in My Server!
📝 sleeping 💤 • ⏱️ 2 hours 15 mins
```

---

## 🛡️ AFK Break Protection

If the target is protected (added via `/afk-break-protection`), only the bot owner can break their AFK:

```
🛡️ Dracula is AFK break protected! Only the bot owner can break their AFK.
```

## 🎨 Design Notes

- All embeds use pink color palette (`#FF69B4`, `#FF1493`, `#E91E63`)
- Thumbnail = user's display avatar (256px, dynamic)
- Author line shows username + status with avatar icon
- Timestamps use Discord's `<t:...:R>` relative format
- Channel replies (mention) auto-delete after 1 second to keep chat clean
- Return message auto-deletes after 5 seconds
- All romantic message lines are randomized from `src/messages.js`

## 📜 Source

All message banks live in [`src/messages.js`](src/messages.js):
- `AFK_SET_MESSAGES` — when going AFK
- `AFK_BREAK_MESSAGES` — when going on break
- `AFK_RETURN_MESSAGES` — when returning
- `AFK_MENTION_MESSAGES` — (legacy) when mentioned

Embed rendering logic lives in [`src/index.js`](src/index.js) — search for `AFK Prefix Commands`, `AFK Return`, `AFK Mention`, and `afkbreak`.
